1. Demographics of players skews strongly toward males (84%) in age range of 20 -24. Majority of purchases comes this demographic.
2. Despite being a smaller represented demographic, non-males appear to have a higher average purchase per player. Their price point is closer matched to 
	the price of more popular and profitable items. Male players purchase on average lower per player, with their purchase point
	falling below most of the popular and profitable items
3. Price resistance towards items is potentially not an issue. We see that top spenders on average spend more per unit than the average unit price of $3.05. 
	Additionally, the most popular items all have price points above the average unit price.
